Place your exported SVG here:
- Copy the file you uploaded (Home.svg) into src/assets/Home.svg


Notes: if your SVG contains external fonts or CSS, consider exporting it as a cleaned SVG from Figma (Outline text) or use the image tag as above.

# CoinSphere — Frontend (Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind)


## Quick start
1. Copy the project files into a new folder.
2. Put your Figma-exported `Home.svg` into `src/assets/Home.svg`.
3. Install dependencies:


```bash
npm install
```


4. Start dev server:


```bash
npm run dev
```


Open the dev URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).


## Options & next steps
- Inline the SVG as JSX to animate or change colors programmatically.
- Add React Router if you need multiple pages.
- Hook to real APIs or add a wallet-connect button.
